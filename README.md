# Wine Quality Prediction Project
By: Leticia Genao
Course: N.U. ANA680

## Overview
This repository contains projects for predicting wine quality using various technologies such as Heroku and AWS SageMaker, incorporating both Docker and non-Docker environments.

## Projects
1. **Heroku Deployment**: A Ridge regression model deployed on Heroku that predicts wine quality from physicochemical properties.
   - [Read more here](./Part1_HerokuDeployment/README.md)
   - [Live Application on Heroku](https://winequalityapp-d6fc38e6a369.herokuapp.com/)
2. **AWS SageMaker Deployment**: This includes both Docker and non-Docker versions of deploying a linear regression model on AWS SageMaker.
   - [Read more here](./Part2_AWSSageMaker/README.md)

## Dataset
The project uses the Wine Quality Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes separate datasets for red and white wines.
- Data Source: [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

## Repository Structure
- `/Part1_HerokuDeployment`: Contains all files necessary for deploying the wine quality prediction model on Heroku.
- `/Part2_AWSSageMaker`: Contains notebooks and Docker files for deploying the model on AWS SageMaker.

## Usage
Each subdirectory contains a detailed README with instructions on how to run and deploy the models.
